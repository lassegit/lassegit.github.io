The benefits of weight-loss and minimizing the risks of lifestyle diseases outweigh the malnutrition that vegan diets are likely to cause. Extending this recommendation to pregnant and childern seems irresponsible. But given that 39.6% of the US population are obese, I read ADA's recommendation more as a testimony to the general appalling health situation in the population. It is pragmatism, not hard science.
